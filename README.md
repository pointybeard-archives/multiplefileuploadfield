# Field: Multiple File Upload

This extension uses HTML5 and some JS to allow multiple files to be selected at once and subsequently uploaded. 

It uses code from the [Unique File Upload](https://github.com/michael-e/uniqueuploadfield) field by Michael Eichelsdoerfer and Hashed Upload Field by Rowan Lewis to ensure the filename is unique.

## Origin

This extension is a variation of the "Hashed Upload" field by Rowan Lewis and the "[Unique File Upload](https://github.com/michael-e/uniqueuploadfield)" field by Michael Eichelsdoerfer


## Installation

1. Upload the 'multiplefileuploadfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Multiple File Upload", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Multiple File Upload" field to your sections.

## Todo

- Allow the unique filename option to be turned off if desired.
